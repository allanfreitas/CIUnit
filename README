			CIUnit
		=====================

CIUnit is a Unit Testing Framework for CodeIgniter.

I have never been happy with the basic barebones support for Unit Testing 
on CodeIgniter. Even in the latest release, nothing much has changed.

This is a project which will match very much with NUnit. Even though NUnit 
is for .NET which is very strongly statically typed, PHP is duck-typed.
Care will be maintained for this difference.

The main reason for not using unit_test library from stock CodeIgniter 
is that it is crippled in terms of functionality. Probably I am biased 
towards NUnit or the CodeIgniter devs don't want to add more tests 
so as to control the bloat.

Finally, I love CodeIgniter. It is the only PHP Framework I could start 
working without any problems. The documentation rocks. There are a few 
problems which I want to fix. 

Keep an eye on this project. That's all Folks.
